# Your users deserve great performance

Modern web development is all about performance and giving users a native-like experience. Any 
delay is fatal and people will stop using your app and move to a native alternative instead. You can not afford this, as your very own livelyhood is at stake. With every millisecond your end users wait or are delayed you are one step closer to homelessness. Let's face it, this is not good. 

Luckily enough, JavaScript and modern development tooling and practices give us the chance to counteract this problem and save you from a life on the street.

# Redact.js to the rescue

Redact.js is an opionated micro-framework that rocket-boosts your apps. Simply by including the 

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>…</head>
<body>
…
<script src="redact.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
